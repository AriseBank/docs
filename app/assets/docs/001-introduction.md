# Bitcoin Developer Docs

Bitcoin was one of the more complete and workable systems that we dealt with. Very straightforward documentation, a high quality blockchain explorer (Insights) and many workable libraries like BitcoinJ. The downside to this, is these high quality Bitcoin additions have been ported to other cryptocurrencies in a low quality fashion, many of these projects have been abandoned and therefore, were the reasoning for CoinDocs. Although Bitcoin is the highest quality and best documented cryptocurrency, very close to the quality of Ethereum, it isn't without it's issues. We have created documentation below on how to install everything from Bitcoin's Core to much needed libaries to create the ultimate Bitcoin backend/frontend for anyone from exchanges to future digital asset banking systems.
